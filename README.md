# BU BF591 Final Project - RShiny App

For this project, I developed an R Shiny application to examine a gene expression dataset comprised of RNASeq data from 20 individuals with Huntington's disease and 49 control samples. This dataset can be accessed on GEO (GSE64810) or downloaded from the `data` directory in this repo.
