```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
HD_data <- read.delim("data/HD_sampleinfo.txt")
Control_data <- read.delim("data/Control_sampleinfo.txt")
sample_information <- bind_rows(HD_data,Control_data)
write_csv(sample_information,"data/sample_information.csv",na="NA")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
